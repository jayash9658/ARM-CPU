# ARM-Inspired CPU in Verilog

## Overview
This project is an **ARM-inspired CPU** implemented in Verilog. The CPU supports basic data processing, memory operations, and branching instructions. It is designed to be simple yet efficient for educational and experimental purposes.

## Features
- **Data Processing Instructions**: `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `ORR`
- **Memory Operations**: `STR` (Store Register), `LDR` (Load Register)
- **Branching Instruction**: `B` (Branch)
- **Pipelined Design** for efficient execution
- **Register File with General-Purpose Registers**
- **Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Stages**
